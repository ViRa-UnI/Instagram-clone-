1. Dependencies: Both the server-side and client-side package.json files will share some dependencies such as "react", "express", "mongoose", "cors", "dotenv", "axios", etc.

2. Exported Variables: The routes, controllers, and models files will export various functions and schemas that will be used across the application. For example, User.js will export the User schema, authRoutes.js will export the authentication routes, etc.

3. Data Schemas: User.js, Post.js, and Comment.js will define the data schemas for users, posts, and comments respectively. These schemas will be used across various routes and controllers.

4. DOM Element IDs: The client-side React components (Home.js, Profile.js, SignIn.js, etc.) will contain various DOM elements with unique IDs that will be used by JavaScript functions. For example, a form in SignIn.js might have an ID of "signin-form".

5. Message Names: The server-side controllers (userController.js, postController.js, etc.) might use specific message names for sending responses. For example, a successful sign-in might send a message with the name "signin-success".

6. Function Names: Various functions will be defined and used across the application. For example, a function named "createPost" might be defined in postController.js and used in postRoutes.js.

7. Context: The context files (authContext.js, postContext.js, etc.) will define and export context for various parts of the application. These contexts will be used across various React components.

8. Styles: The CSS files (global.css, navbar.css, etc.) will define styles that will be used across various React components.

9. API: The API files (index.js, auth.js, posts.js, etc.) will define and export functions for making API requests. These functions will be used across various React components.
